## üåü Overview

This is an **ASP.NET Core Web API** designed for managing product categories and their relationships with products. Leveraging **Entity Framework Core**, this API provides a comprehensive suite of RESTful endpoints for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on `ProductCategory` entities, including the ability to manage associated `Product` data.

This API is an ideal backend solution for e-commerce platforms, product catalog systems, or any application requiring robust category and product organization.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* **RESTful API Endpoints**: Full CRUD support for `ProductCategory` entities.
* **Product Relationship**: Seamlessly manage `Product` data associated with categories (e.g., a category can have multiple products).
* **Eager Loading**: Retrieve category data along with their related products using `Include`.
* **Database Integration**: Utilizes **Entity Framework Core** for efficient data access and persistence with SQL Server (configurable).
* **Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation**: Interactive API documentation for easy testing and understanding of all available endpoints.
* **Environment-Specific Configuration**: Configured to handle different settings for development and production environments.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* [.NET SDK 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) or later.
* A SQL Server instance (LocalDB, Express, or full SQL Server).
* (Optional but Recommended) An API testing tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or [Thunder Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client) (for VS Code).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/mdshohagkhan/product-category-api.git](https://github.com/mdshohagkhan/product-category-api.git)
    cd product-category-api
    ```
    *(**Important:** Please update the clone URL if your repository URL is different.)*

2.  **Configure Database Connection String:**
    Open the `appsettings.json` file and set up your database connection string under the `ConnectionStrings` section to point to your SQL Server instance.

    ```json
    {
      "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=ProductCategoryDb;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
      },
      // ... other settings
    }
    ```
    *Adjust `Server` and `Database` names as per your local SQL Server setup.*

3.  **Apply Migrations:**
    Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run the following commands to create or update your database schema based on your models:
    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update
    ```
    *(If you haven't created initial migrations, you might need to run `dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate` first, then `dotnet ef database update`)*.

4.  **Restore NuGet Packages:**
    Ensure all necessary dependencies are downloaded:
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    Start the API application:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
    The API will typically run on `http://localhost:5000` (HTTP) or `http://localhost:5001` (HTTPS).

## üó∫Ô∏è API Endpoints

Once the application is running, you can access the API at the base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/api/ProductCategorys`).

### Product Categories (`/api/ProductCategorys`)

* **`GET /api/ProductCategorys`**: Get a list of all product categories, including their associated products.
* **`GET /api/ProductCategorys/{id}`**: Get a specific product category by its ID, including its associated products.
* **`POST /api/ProductCategorys`**: Create a new product category.
    * **Request Body Example (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "categoryName": "Electronics",
          "description": "Gadgets and electronic devices",
          "products": [
            {
              "productName": "Smartphone",
              "price": 799.99
            },
            {
              "productName": "Smart TV",
              "price": 1200.00
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
* **`PUT /api/ProductCategorys/{id}`**: Update an existing product category and its related products.
    * **Request Body Example (JSON):**
        ```json
        {
          "productCategoryID": 1, // Existing Category ID
          "categoryName": "Home Appliances (Updated)",
          "description": "Updated category for home appliances",
          "products": [
            {
              "productID": 101, // Existing Product ID to update
              "productName": "Refrigerator",
              "price": 950.00
            },
            {
              "productID": 0, // New Product (ProductID should be 0 or omitted for new products)
              "productName": "Dishwasher",
              "price": 600.00
            }

        ```
* **`DELETE /api/ProductCategorys/{id}`**: Delete a product category by its ID.
